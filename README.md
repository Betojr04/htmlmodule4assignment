## OVERVIEW:This assignment will assess your understanding of the HTML concepts covered in Module 4. Youâ€™ll practice working with essential HTML elements, such as forms, tables, navigation bars, and images.

INSTRUCTIONS: In VS Code, please complete the following tasks in a .html file.

Create a New HTML Page:

Start with a basic HTML5 structure:

<!DOCTYPEhtml>

<htmllang="en">

<head>

  <metacharset="UTF-8">

  <metaname="viewport"content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<title>Module4HTMLAssignment</title>

### Part 1: Form Creation

Create a Basic Contact Form with the following fields:

* Name (text input)
* Email (email input)

Create a Table that displays some sample product data:

* Columns: Product Name, Price, and Quantity.
* Rows: At least 3 products with their respective details.

Bonus: Add a header row to label the columns.
